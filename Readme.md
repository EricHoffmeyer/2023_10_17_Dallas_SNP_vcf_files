# 2023_10_17_Dallas_SNP_vcf_files

This repository contains the analysis of vcf files received for Dallas' Down Syndrome samples.

Folders contain the following:

## 2023_10_17_results
Results from 2023_10_17_vcf_exploration.Rmd where a single sample was run through an annotation pipeline

## 2024_02_14_resuts
Results from 2024_02_14_Common_DS_Mutations where the changes were mapped to gene exons and then common mutations shared in all/most samples were identified.
UPDATE: This did not have quite the functionality that I wanted. Namely to identify the mutations (SNP, insertion, deletion, etc) and a way to compare across multiple samples.

## 2024_03_04_VCF_class.qmd
Results from 2024_03_04_VCF_class.qmd where I use a new workflow to read and process the VCF files.

## 2024_03_06_vcf2maf.qmd
